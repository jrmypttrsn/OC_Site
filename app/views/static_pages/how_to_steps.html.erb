<h1>4 Steps to OneCert Organic Certification</h1>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare Organic System Plan (OSP)</h3>

<p>You must have an Organic System Plan (OSP) that complies with the standards
of the country where you will be selling your organic products. Your OSP must be
approved by your certifier. The <a href="download.htm">certification packet</a>
from OneCert contains all the forms and checklist you need to prepare your OSP.
</p>

<h3>Step 2: Submit application & OSP for approval</h3>

<p>You will enjoy the prompt, professional information provided by the OneCert
staff. We want you to fully understand the requirements so that your application
is successful. OneCert staff will provide feedback on your OSP to be sure that
it is complete and complies with the applicable standards. Allow as much time as
possible to complete your initial certification. We suggest submitting your
application at least three months before you need to have your certificate.
</p>

<h3>Step 3: On-site inspection</h3>

<p>The on-site inspection must take place at a time when you can demonstrate
compliance or your capacity to comply. For farms, this is usually during the
growing season.� For handling and processing facilities, you would need to show
how you will implement your OSP. The inspector will prepare a report that is sent
to OneCert for review.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Review and certification decision</h3>

<p>OneCert will review your file of application materials and
inspection report.� If all standards are complied with, you will be issued a
certificate of organic certification.� If all standards have not been met, you
will receive a notice of noncompliance with an opportunity for corrective
action.</p>
